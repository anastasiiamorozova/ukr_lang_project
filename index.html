          How the full-scale war has pushed Ukrainians to abandon Russian
          language
        </h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          The active phase of Russia's war against Ukraine has prompted more and
          more Ukrainians to speak their state language. Many of them have
          minimized or abandoned Russian language, as well as everything
          Russian.<br />
          Centuries of persecution of Ukrainian speakers in the Russian Empire,
          the Soviet Union and present-day Russia have not passed without a
          trace. And even with the independence of Ukraine, a huge number of
          people continued to speak the familiar Russian language.
        </p>
        <p class="subhead">
          However, the Orange Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, the
          annexation of Crimea, the war in the east, the full-scale invasion
          have affected the desire of Ukrainians to continue speaking Russian.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I collected and analyzed 3.75 million Ukrainian posts on Facebook
            and Telegram, as well as Google Trends data, to find out how the war
            affected Ukrainians' language preferences;
          </li>
          <li>
            I talked to people from different regions of Ukraine and determined
            what motivated them to give up Russian;

      <h1>Julianna Skibitskaya: "I don't communicate in Russian anymore"</h1>
      <p>
        Journalist Yulianna Skibitskaya lives and works in Kiev. She spent her
        childhood in the mid-90s in Zaporizhzhya - in a Russian-speaking
        environment. In high school, the girl's educational institution switched
        to the Ukrainian language of teaching. However, she still had to finish
        her studies according to the old version of textbooks - in Russian.
      </p>

      <p>
        "For quite a long time I had as many lessons of Russian language and
        literature as lessons of Ukrainian, - says Yulianna. - You could say
        that all my childhood and for quite a long time in my youth I was
        brought up in a Russian-speaking environment, and I probably only had a
        couple of friends from Zaporizhzhya who spoke Ukrainian."
      </p>

      <p>
        At the height of the Revolution of Dignity in 2013, she traveled to Kiev
        to express her position. At that time, not only residents of the city,
        but also people who had specially arrived from other regions came to
        Maidan and the streets of the capital to protest. Yulianna was among
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        "In Kiev, I didn't have the feeling that it was a completely different
        world. I do not remember that Kiev then was strongly Ukrainian-speaking,
        - recalls the journalist. - I had friends there, at work, somewhere else
        - and they were all Russian-speaking. I was brought up in Russian, I did
        not want to give it up.
      </p>

      <div class="svg-container">
        <object data="kyiv.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
      </div>

      <p>
        Over the years, more and more Ukrainian-speaking acquaintances appeared
        in Yulianna's entourage and speaking Ukrainian became a habit, although
        there was no goal to stop speaking Russian. It didn't appear until the
        day of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022.
      </p>

      <h1>
        Yulia Khodyunova: "When I speak a lot of Ukrainian, I even get
        physically tired"
      </h1>

      <p>
        According to the last Ukrainian census in 2001, up to 4% of the
        population in the West of the country considered Russian to be their
        native language. Pensioner Yulia Khodyunova from Rivne belongs to this
        small group. However, after the full-scale invasion, she switched
        completely to Ukrainian. Her mother comes from the Kharkiv region. When
        she was young, she moved to Siberia to earn a living. There she met her
        future husband and had children. From an early age, her mother instilled
        in Yulia a love for Ukrainian culture, but the family spoke Russian.
        Ukrainian words were remembered only from folk songs. Her mother sang
        them to her exclusively in Ukrainian.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later Yulia moved to Ukraine to work at the Rovno nuclear power plant.
        In those years it was possible to get an apartment for working there.
      </p>

      <p>
        While in 2018 in Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv regions, the vast
        majority of Internet queries were in Ukrainian, in Volyn and Rivne
        regions quite a few people spoke Russian. However, already by 2023, the
        number of Google queries in Ukrainian exceeded the number of queries in
        Russian by 3-4 times.
      </p>

      <p>
        In public groups in social networks there were almost no messages of
        residents of Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Volyn and Rivne regions in
        Russian. But in the first months of the invasion, the use of the Russian
        language increased sharply in the regions - then residents of eastern
        regions of Ukraine evacuated to the west of the country. In March and
        April 2022, the share of Russian language in these regions grew, and
        later went down again.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the full-scale invasion, Yulia decided to completely abandon
        Russian in communication. However, in such a Ukrainian-speaking region,
        it was not easy for Yulia to find opportunities to learn the language
        with the help of specialists. According to her, there were mostly
        English language courses in Rivne, and similar courses for learning
        Ukrainian could not be found immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        "After the first victims, I wanted to change my place of birth. But this
        is my personal story. Yes, I was born in Russia. What can you do about
        it now? I myself began to be corrupted by my speech. I guess I've
        reached a point of no return, says the woman. - I can't say that twenty
        lessons have passed and I'm suddenly fluent in Ukrainian. When I speak a
        lot of Ukrainian, I even get physically tired. But this is the only way
        to improve the language."
      </p>

      <h1>
        Viktor Kachanov: "They asked me not to agonize and switch to Russian"
      </h1>

      <p>
        Pensioner Viktor Kachanov was born and lives in Dnipro. He is a
        volunteer and photographer, as well as an active participant of the
        "United" conversation club. Back in the days of Maidan, in 2013, his
        friends began to switch to Ukrainian. With the beginning of the war in
        the east, even more of them preferred Ukrainian to Russian. However,
        then Viktor did not dare to switch to the state language. The point of
        no return was the Russian invasion in 2022.
      </p>

      <p>
        Viktor explains, he studied in a Soviet-era school. At that time, his
        school did not teach Ukrainian. In conversation classes, he was
        energized by the mutual support. "No one says you're bad at something.
        Everyone tries to help each other," the man shares. His old
        acquaintances and some of his relatives did not immediately believe that
        Viktor had seriously decided to switch to Ukrainian.
      </p>
      <p>
        "They asked me not to agonize and switch to Russian. However, I did not
        make concessions," recalls a participant of the "United" conversation
        club. - Moments of personal attitude - desire and language stability -
        are very important. At first, I formed a vocabulary on everyday and
        professional topics. Waking up in the morning, I described my actions in
        Ukrainian and destroyed the switch to Russian. I changed the language of
        all gadgets and social networks, read and listened to audiobooks in
        Ukrainian".
      </p>

      <p>
        Now Viktor Kachanov finds it difficult to communicate in Russian. He
        urges not to be afraid of making mistakes, to speak Surzhyk, to study
        Ukrainian history and the formation of the nation. The man is sure that
        until a person himself realizes that he needs it, no one can force him.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to data in the social networks Telegram and Facebook, in the
        year since the invasion, the use of Ukrainian language in relation to
        Russian has doubled - from 22.3% to 44%. If before the invasion the
        share of Russian-language messages amounted to about 78% of messages,
        two years later it has decreased to 56%. This is confirmed by the
        results of a sociological survey in the Kyiv Digital app: today 86% of
        Kyiv residents consider Ukrainian their native language, but only 44% of
        Kyiv residents use it in everyday life.
      </p>

      <h1>Do people write the same language they think?</h1>

      <p>
        Independent creative Marina Chernyavskaya also sees a commercial problem
        in the Ukrainianization of content on the Internet. She now works on a
        freelance basis, helping businesses to build their marketing and PR
        strategies. Until 2012, Marina worked in the Ukrainian branch of a
        Russian advertising agency. For the startups she worked with, the
        Russian language was always more advantageous, because this way they
        could reach not only customers or users from Ukraine and Russia, but
        also from countries where Russian is quite common among the population,
        such as Kazakhstan.
      </p>

      <p>
        In her opinion, the big changes in the marketing and content industry on
        the Internet occurred due to the fact that Russian businesses left the
        market, and advertising agencies stopped focusing on two countries at
        once. At the same time, it was primarily the government's initiatives at
        the legislative level that led to real results, followed by changes in
        the consciousness of the population.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The only radical noticeable fact is the law on language. Not because we
        have become more conscious, but because we can be fined for a sign in
        Russian. Television and radio advertisements were in Ukrainian, but
        Internet advertisements, which are more popular and effective, remained
        in Russian."
      </p>

      <p>
        The law that Marina recalls was signed by President Petro Poroshenko in
        2019. It obliged all advertisers and media on the Internet to use the
        Ukrainian language, without restricting the existence of the Russian
        version of the website. Thus any outdoor advertising in public places
        and advertising on the Internet is obliged to be published only in the
        Ukrainian language.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Now the attitude has changed not only to the product, but also to the
        market as a whole, we started to look with more respect at what we do
        ourselves, and to look less at Moscow and at Moscow salaries, although
        this continued, because we are traumatized by it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the state's attempts to change the language habits of the
        population, before the invasion almost half of Ukrainian families spoke
        Russian in everyday life. Now the stumbling block in the language debate
        is the Russian language option on selling websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most popular queries on Google have the same trend - the use of Russian
        is decreasing, Ukrainian is increasing. Most often in Ukrainian people
        are looking for congratulations, including birthday greetings. However,
        some queries such as "buy a car" or "iPhone price" related to sales are
        not really so dynamic.
